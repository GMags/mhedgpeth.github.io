There are three elements to every solution:

  1. Knowing the problem well enough to know a few solutions and what you think is best
  2. Bringing together everyone's idea of a solution into one strategy
  3. Execution

It's so easy to skip step #2. Why would you need that [if you are so smart](/surrounded/) and already know the solutions?

The problem is in order to _really _do #3 you have [to have alignment](/alignment/). When you get to the end and have the solution, you should look around and see a crowd around you celebrating the accomplishment of _their _problems with _their _solution.

You are solving this together.

If you try to solve alone you will quickly realize that you spent a lot of energy going in the wrong direction.
