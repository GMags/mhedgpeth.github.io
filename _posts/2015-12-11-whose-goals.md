There have been times where my goals were [clear, written, specific](/planned-thinking/). When that happens a whole range of possibilities exist. The power of specific goals always amazes me.

Other times I'm coasting with no goals. I'm just making it to the next thing and not really thinking about it.

It's easy to think that I just didn't have anyone's goals during those periods. A closer inspection reveals otherwise:<!--more-->

I was meeting the goals of my more savvy colleagues that had clear goals themselves.

I was meeting the goals of Facebook or Twitter executives, for more page views, more advertising revenue.

I was meeting the goals of the Dallas Cowboys organization, for me to be a more engaged and thus more lucrative customer.

Goals always exist.

My only choice is between having my goals or someone else's.
