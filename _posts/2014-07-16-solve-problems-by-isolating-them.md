My kids have been drawn into the world of Legos. They love [Ninjago](http://www.lego.com/en-us/ninjago) and [The Lego Movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/).

It also turns out that we have a [Six Flags](https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas) nearby. Fast roller coasters. Every amusement park craziness imaginable. We spent last summer doing that, and let me tell you, mom and I really got sick of it. But the kids absolutely loved it. They even wanted to do it again this summer.

So DFW area: lego land: check. amusement park: check. [lego amusement park](http://california.legoland.com/)? That will be a trip to California and $4000 please.<!--more-->

It's interesting how **the solution to a problem gets a lot more complicated and a lot more expensive when you combine it with another problem.** I come across this a lot at work. I ruthlessly go through a project and eliminate anything that isn't needed, because I want to ship it as quickly as possible and I know every little thing just adds to the time and complexity and makes the project that much more unrealistic.
