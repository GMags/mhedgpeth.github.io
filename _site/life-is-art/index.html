            <h1>Life is Art</h1>

            <p>Earlier this year, I was pretty excited about some <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/" title="Achievable Contentment">drastic changes</a> we had made in our lifestyle. Whenever I’m excited about something, I must tell someone and my friend at a dinner party at my house was no exception. I excitedly pointed out all the ways that simplicity has led us to a life of greater contentment and tranquility.</p>

<p>I could sense my friend becoming increasingly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Well, not everyone can live that way.”<!--more--></p>

<p>My friend assumed that I view life as a science; that there are certain rules that <em>must</em> be followed and a right and wrong way to do things.</p>

<p>I completely disagree with that notion. To me <strong>life is more like a work of art.</strong> You have a canvas on which to paint decisions, consequences, and ultimately meaning. Every life is as different as every work of art.</p>

<p>When a painter presents her painting, she is expressing herself in a unique way that is unlike anyone else. The painter has <em>her</em> way of painting. To her it <em>feels</em> like the right way, because, of course, she did it that way. Another painter may do it totally differently. A wonderful and mysterious thing happens in the gallery: <strong>each painter admires the brilliance and beauty in the other’s work of art.</strong></p>

<p>So I am creating a work of art that I hope to be beautiful and meaningful.</p>

<p>I’m not creating a life of the entrepreneur who spends her nights and weekends creating a groundbreaking service that improves the lives of millions of people. But I can appreciate her work of art.</p>

<p>I’m not creating a life of the philanthropist who travels the world to find a way to cure malaria worldwide. But I can appreciate his work of art.</p>

<p>I’m not creating a life of the video game developer who works for two solid years to create a game that captures the imagination of a teenager who stays out of trouble because he has something to do when he’s out of school. But I can appreciate his work of art.</p>

<p>I’m not creating a life of a hospice nurse who works the night shift helping dying patients find dignity and meaning in their final days. But I can appreciate her work of art.</p>

<p>I’m creating a life of tranquility, meaning, and purpose. I do this through simplifying life in every facet, achieving in the marketplace through a fearless pursuit of adding value, and creating margin in my life to build a legacy with those around me, especially my family.</p>

<p>This is my work of art. This is the journey I will share with you.</p>

<p><strong>It isn’t the only way.</strong></p>

<p>But I want it to be beautiful, and I want to share it with you because I hope we can inspire each other to make our lives a beautiful work of art.</p>
