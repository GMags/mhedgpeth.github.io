            <h1>Sanitize Your Smartphone with Republic Wireless</h1>

            <p>The invention of the iPhone will probably be one of the key technological events of my lifetime. It changed the game from quirky Blackberry kind-of-phones, to a new experience that delivered a whole set of new capabilities in people’s lives. It has changed <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/" title="Ten Takeaways from the Last 10 Years at Radiant/NCR">the businesses I serve</a> and will continue to change our lives for years to come.</p>

<p>Once I finally got an iPhone it took over my life. This coincided with the birth of my children, so I spent a lot of time on the iPhone while they were at the park, or sleeping, or messing around at our house.</p>

<p><strong>Then I realized that I will never get those moments back.</strong><!--more--></p>

<p>I realized that the promise of convenience and greater efficiency does not line up with <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/" title="Achievable Contentment">my personal goals</a> because my personal goals are to <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/" title="Life is Art">live a life of meaning, love, and connection</a>, especially with my family.</p>

<p>To put it more simply, <strong>I was on my phone and ignoring my family.</strong></p>

<p>What to do about this? I considered going away from a smartphone. That didn’t seem possible because there were times where it really did serve me. I tried to make a few rules like, “Stop ignoring my children,” but those didn’t seem to work when the siren song of Facebook and email came singing.</p>

<p>On top of that, I was spending over a thousand dollars a year on this habit that wasn’t serving me.</p>

<p><strong>Then I learned about a better way: Republic Wireless.</strong> With Republic Wireless, I bought a phone for $300* and now spend $10 a month on my mobile phone. I get data through Wi-Fi, which, by the way, exists at home and at work. I don’t get data on the way home from work. If I’m traveling, I get the option to change to the $25 a month plan that has data. I can even change it back to the $10 plan when I get home and only pay for the $25 plan prorated for the amount of days I used it.</p>

<p>This means that I don’t instinctively go for the phone when I’m out and about. It’s a tool; it’s not my master. It also means if I need it to direct me somewhere I can type in directions before I leave when I’m on Wi-Fi, and the smartphone will get me there.</p>

<p>I feel like I have the best of both worlds. Combine that with my $10/month landline, I now have no excuse to be on my phone…ever. <strong>It’s an accessory. It’s not my whole life.</strong> Now I can live with the best elements of it and leave the rest alone.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in freeing your life from the insane addiction from the smartphone, you can get $10 off of Republic Wireless (as well as give me $10 off on my bill) by going <a href="http://rwshar.es/6lhy" target="_blank">here</a>. Enjoy!</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can get them even cheaper for $99 for an off-contract phone. Do the math and you’ll save a bundle while being able to spend less time on your phone. It’s a win-win!</li>
