            <h1>Focus with the Amazon Kindle</h1>

            <p>I’ve been writing about <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/life-is-art/" title="Life is Art">focusing on what matters</a> lately by <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/achievable-contentment/" title="Achievable Contentment">making good choices</a> with how and what you consume. Some things are just a complete waste of time like the <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/rubbernecking-with-the-locals/" title="Rubbernecking with the Locals">local news</a>. Other things have a good alternative, like <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/the-economist-keeps-it-real/" title="The Economist Keeps it Real">reading the Economist</a> instead of going to <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/escaping-with-the-news/" title="Escaping with the News">news sites</a>.</p>

<p>As I wrote last time, though, in this mobile world that isn’t enough. You have to make sure your smartphone is serving you and not enslaving you. And beyond that I’m convinced <strong>to lead a life of growth and meaning you need to read.</strong> Probably more than you are right now.</p>

<p>So how do we do that? The solutions that come to mind immediately are: on our smartphone, a paper book, or a tablet. I’m going to talk about a better way to read books: through the Amazon Kindle.<!--more--></p>

<p>A few years back <a href="http://www.chrisdikes.com/" target="_blank">my friend Chris</a> asked me what I thought about the Kindle, and my opinion to him as of July 16, 2010 was: “<em>It seems like having a book would be better.</em>” Well, thankfully Chris didn’t listen to my awful advice and bought one, told me about it, changed my mind, and I haven’t looked back.</p>

<p>Here’s what’s so great about the Kindle:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Distractionless:</strong> yes, that’s a feature and not a bug. I like it that there aren’t pop ups telling me all about the emails I’m not reading or the cool Facebook posts that I need to be looking into. I’m here to read. The Kindle helps me read.</li>
  <li><strong>Battery Life:</strong> I don’t have to be preoccupied with powering the stupid thing while I’m using it. I can read. I have to charge it every once and a while. It’s not like the power sucking smartphone or tablet.</li>
  <li><strong>Position Independent:</strong> this may seem small to some, but I like reading while I’m laying down. And I get comfortable holding a book in one hand. Then I read fast and get to the other side of the book. So I have to move to read the other section. It seems like a small thing, and admittedly a first-world problem, but I love how I can read the Kindle with one hand laying on the same side for as long as it is comfortable.</li>
  <li><strong>Sleep Friendly Lighting:</strong> I have the Kindle paperwhite that doesn’t blast light into my eyes and keep me up. I can do a little nighttime reading with a very small amount of light. It also doesn’t distract my wife.</li>
  <li><strong>Borrower Capable:</strong> I have learned to take advantage of my library’s borrower privileges on the Kindle. This is easy once you figure it out. I do admit to buying more books than I would have before, but I think that’s a good thing as long as I read them.</li>
  <li><strong>Keeps Your Place:</strong> I pick up the book and read exactly where I left off. I don’t have to think about it. I just go.</li>
  <li><strong>Read More:</strong> I’ve read much more than before. If I’m interested in a topic, I can get a book on that topic and read through it quickly while I have a passion and interest in the book.</li>
  <li><strong>Portable:</strong> I admit to not doing it very often, but if I want to, I can read on my smartphone or even my computer to continue my reading.</li>
</ol>

<p>I highly recommend going for a Kindle. You need to read to meet your goals, and in my mind there is no better way to do so than with the Kindle.</p>
