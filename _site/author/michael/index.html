        <p>My name is Michael Hedgpeth, I work as a Software Architect at NCR in the DFW area. I work to bring technical and business stakeholders together to form a common platform for success. I do this primarily in three ways: (1) through a deep and regular commitment to learning, (2) by motivating others around me to have the courage to do what they know must be done for success, and (3) by consistently aligning a solid strategy with the reality of every day.</p>

<p>I post an average of a post a week</p>

<p>Another option for reading through the blog is <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/christmas-with-russians/" title="Christmas with Russians">to start at the beginning</a> and follow the post navigation at the end of the post all the way to the present. I’ve done this with a few blogs and have had a wonderful time getting a brain dump from a single writer. I’d be honored if you read along with me in this way as well.</p>

<h1 id="biography">Biography</h1>

<p>I grew up in Arlington, TX with three brothers in an LDS home. My parents and community taught me the value of hard work, education, and community. We never had a lot of money, but my mom and dad always instilled in me the value of making a difference and leaving a legacy. The values they instilled in me live on in me and are a constant source of guidance for me.</p>

<p>After high school I stayed local and graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with a Bachelor of Science in Management Information Systems. I graduated four weeks before 9/11 and got a job as a Java programmer at a small workers compensation case management firm just five days before 9/11.</p>

<p>If you remember those times, during my  sophomore year in 1999 everyone was going to be rich, during my junior year in 2000 everyone was going to be employed, and during my senior year in 2001 everyone was going to end up cooking hamburgers. It was a crazy job market but I bought the best suit a credit card could buy and was fortunate to have people believe in me.</p>

<p>Two and a half years later I ended up at Radiant Systems (later <a href="http://www.ncr.com">NCR</a>) and have been there the past eleven years. The people I have worked with over the last eleven years have changed my life for the better in so many ways.</p>

<p>My wife Annie is my secret to success. She’s creative, hard working, and beautiful. You get to experience her through her photography for the site and her editing. Annie and I are working more and more together on stuff and I absolutely love it.</p>

<p>I have three boys and yes that’s crazy. It’s kind of strange how they just latch onto every one of my behaviors, even the bad ones. But they do and we are all growing through it. Just the other day we were taking a picture and the boys weren’t smiling. So I said, “Say poop” and we had the perfect picture. Poop seems to be the magic word for funny when you’re a boy.</p>

<p>I’m seeking a life of meaning. I want to grow to be the best person I can be. Part of that journey must be shared with others. I hope to find like-minded people who can help others find their way to a life that meets their goals on a deep and meaningful level. I hope you will join me.</p>

            <p>A few months ago I caught up with Julian Dunn in Ghent about what he was up to. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF9IATUask">talk on orchestration</a> was instrumental in forming <a href="/orchestration-maturity-model-with-chef/">our approach</a> to solving the problem with Consul and his <a href="http://www.juliandunn.net/2015/12/04/the-oncoming-train-of-enterprise-container-deployments/">blog post on docker</a> showed me he was thinking deeply and critically about some interesting topics. I reached out to him to learn more about what he was up to and spent some time with him to learn about Habitat.</p>
