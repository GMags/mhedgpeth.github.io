            <h1>Achievable Contentment</h1>

            <p>“You’re doing great here, and you’re an asset to what we’re doing. We think you have a bright future with us.” My boss was obviously happy <a href="http://hedge-ops.com/ten-takeaways-from-the-last-10-years-at-radiantncr/" title="Ten Takeaways from the Last 10 Years at Radiant/NCR">with my performance</a> and was telling me about it in no uncertain terms.</p>

<p>“That’s great, and I appreciate it, but when will I get promoted to Software Architect?”<!--more--></p>

<p>I wanted more than anything at that point in my career to be a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/2010/snapshots/1.html">Software Architect</a>. The title comes with respect, a great salary, and a leadership position within a software development organization. Most people who knew my goal never questioned its efficacy.</p>

<p>…But I now see that it was the wrong goal.</p>

<p><strong>A good goal is one that delivers what it promises: contentment and happiness.</strong></p>

<p>The contentment I envisioned after getting the promotion very quickly became discontentment wrapped around another, bigger goal. All of the sudden I wanted to be a Senior Software Architect. And then more. And more. This is insanity.</p>

<p>There is a better way: goals that lead to contentment. Some examples:</p>

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table style="width:100%; " class="easy-table easy-table-default " border="0">
    <tr>
      <th>
        You'll never be content with having
      </th>
      
      <th>
        But you will be content with
      </th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        The next promotion
      </td>
      
      <td>
        Doing work that matters and being fairly rewarded for it
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        A big raise
      </td>
      
      <td>
        Spending less than you make, whatever it is
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        A new luxury car
      </td>
      
      <td>
        A car you can afford
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        The spouse of your dreams
      </td>
      
      <td>
        A marriage based on love, acceptance, and peace
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>In the left column, everything seems so deceptively simple. “All I want is a Mercedes.” Well, yes, but <em>what happens when you get the Mercedes? What <strong>then</strong></em><strong>?</strong> The left side is one in which you never end up at a destination. You are always striving, always anxious, always gunning for the next thing.</p>

<p>The left column is a series of steps in life that all follow a commonly accepted pattern of “going for the next thing”, but arriving nowhere important. These goals ultimately lead to misery and despair once one inevitably finds this out.</p>

<p>What’s strange is that no one questions this path to success, even though there are so many examples of burned out, depressed, unhappy people who have followed it.</p>

<p>A better definition of success is on the right side. These are achievable goals, not in a few years but right now. The goals aren’t as measurable, and those around you won’t notice them as much as they would a new Mercedes. However, they deliver what they promise: achievable contentment.</p>

<p>Success is achievable contentment through goals that have an end to them. The end of a truly success-oriented goal isn’t <em>another goal.</em> It is contentment and peace.</p>

<p>What are your goals? Where will they lead?</p>
