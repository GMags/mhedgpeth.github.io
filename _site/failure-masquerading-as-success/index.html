            <h1>Failure Masquerading as Success</h1>

            <p>I didn’t have the grades I should have had in high school. My parents didn’t have anything saved up for college when I turned 18*. By living at home, under my mom’s insurance, and getting support from my dad, I was able to end my Junior year of college with a few thousand dollars of student loans and no credit card debt.</p>

<p>But that wasn’t enough. I <em>needed</em> to have a successful college life.<!--more--></p>

<p>I began believing that there was a real risk that I was going to look back at my college life as a failure. People in college are supposed to experience community, friends, fun, unfettered learning. Living with mommy and having a job was seriously impeding those goals. I had only one year to make things right. So I did what any idiotic 20-year-old would do: I quit my job waiting tables at an upscale restaurant in Dallas, moved into a dorm, and maxed out my student loans and credit cards to make it happen.</p>

<p>During the next fourteen months I had a lot of fun. I hung out with interesting people, was in walking distance to most of my life, and expanded my mind through books and interesting classes. Based on the terms I had set out for myself, the year was a success.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest with you: I spent many years paying off the tens of thousands of dollars I borrowed in that fourteen month period. The years of debt repayment that followed brought home an important truth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>what felt like success for those fourteen months was really failure masquerading as success.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When success is real it flows to all areas of life, not just on the area that has the focus. It also flows into the future, not just the present.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When financial success turns a healthy, compatible, and loving marriage into a hate-fest, <em>that’s failure masquerading as success.</em></p>

  <p>When success at work turns colleagues from respect and honor to anger and disdain, <em>that’s failure masquerading as success.</em></p>

  <p>When success in marriage creates isolated, ignored children, <em>that’s failure masquerading as success.</em></p>

  <p>When success on my project this quarter leads to years of rework and confusion, <em>that’s failure masquerading as success.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe success does have tradeoffs. There are <em>failures</em> that always <em>accompany</em> success: having dinner with your family might mean someone else who doesn’t need to do that will get promoted instead of you.</p>

<p><strong>But I don’t believe that a wise definition of success has collateral damage.</strong> I believe a life of peace and balance is possible. Anything else quickly becomes failure masquerading as success.</p>

<p><em>Has failure ever masqueraded as success in your life?</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>What they did do though is tell me over and over again how important it was for me to go to college, something I am thankful for to this day</li>
</ul>
